Gimli UIMA Annotator


Gimli is a library and tool for high-performance and multi-corpus recognition of biomedical entity names.
See https://github.com/davidcampos/gimli

UIMA is an open framework for building analytic applications - to find latent meaning, relationships and relevant facts hidden in unstructured text. 
See http://uima.apache.org/

You need to unzip resources/tools/gdep.zip first.

TODOes:
- even more robust matching of Gimli annotations to UIMA annotations
